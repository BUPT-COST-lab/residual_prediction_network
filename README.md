# residual_prediction_network
This is a TensorFlow implementation of the paper as follows: 

Liu X, Yin J. Stacked residual blocks based encoderâ€“decoder framework for human motion prediction[J]. Cognitive Computation and Systems, 2020, 2(4): 242-246.

## Setup
Required python libraries: tensorflow (>=1.0) + opencv + numpy.
Tested in ubuntu/centOS + nvidia titan X (Pascal) with cuda (>=8.0) and cudnn (>=5.0).


## Training
Use the `scripts/ResNet_short_term_train_2.sh` to train/test by the following commands:
```shell
cd scripts
sh ResNet_short_term_train_2.sh  
```
